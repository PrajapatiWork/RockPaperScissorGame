<h1>Raock Paper Scissors Game</h1>
<p>An outstretched hand is used by each participant to simultaneously make one of three shapes in the hand game rock, paper, scissors, which is often played between two individuals.
These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".</p>
<p>The goal of this mini-project is to automate a computerized player that takes a rock, paper, or scissors as input.</p>
<h3>Technologies used:</h3>

<h3>Rules:</h3>
<p>A rock player will defeat a scissors player ("rock crushes scissors" or occasionally "blunts scissors"), but a paper player will defeat a paper player ("paper covers rock"); a scissors player will defeat a paper player ("scissors cuts paper").
